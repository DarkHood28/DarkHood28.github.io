                <p>
                    When visiting this clearly ridiculous website for the first time you probably thought who the hell is Carter and who am I the mastermind behind creating this exceptional 
                    website? <br><br> My name is Harry Baker, I currently study IT at MidKent College in the UK, I have a passion for all things tech in particular 
                    programming and website development as well as an interest in game development too and have worked on many personal projects before ranging from a speed running
                    game I made in Unity to a portfolio website, both for my college course. <br><br> I've continued to focus on learning and working on personal projects to become 
                    a better programmer and one day during one of our classes, me and my friends were joking about when in the near future we have to build a website marketing our 
                    game we made I said I can just make their websites for them. I started this with for my friend Carter Reid, recently he has been obssessed with the game GTA 6 
                    so as a joke I made a whole website about how obssessed he is and so Carter Loves GTA 6 was born.
